            Thank you for showing interest, 
            here is a quick story of me and
            this website. My programming 
            journey started summer of 2020, 
            I only really took a deep dive commitment only 6 months ago. 
            I am hoping to get into the field and explore and excel in all it has to offer. I like 
            coding all kind of problems 
            from the very basic like adding 
            numbers to the complex ones like
            competitive programming problems.
            I love making projects and games.
            Infact this website is one of my 
            Web Development Projects which 
            is built using HTML and CSS.<br>
            <br>Languages known : HTML, CSS, JavaScript, 
            MySQL.<br> Learning Languages : Data 
            Structures and Algorithm, Git & GitHub.
